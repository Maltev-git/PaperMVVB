\section{Introduction}

%solar wind models; theoretical and empirical
With his theoretical solar wind model \citet{Parker1958} laid the foundations...\\

%in situ spacecraft
Several space missions flew away from Earth's orbit to measure in situ solar wind at different heliocentric distances (e.g. the probes Helios, Voyager, Ulysses...). Voyager~1 is the farthest probe out of the solar system, now covering more than 137~au (cite?). Ulysses was the single probe orbiting the Sun outside the ecliptic and retrieving solar wind measurements from the poles of the Sun. So far, Helios~2 made the nearest in situ solar wind measurements with \SI{0.29}{\au}, followed closely by Helios~1 with \SI{0.31}{\au}. The new mission Parker~Solar~Probe (PSP), whose planned launch date is in mid 2018, aims to reach further down into the Sun's atmosphere.

%Solar Probe Plus mission
The main part of the PSP mission's goals is to gain insight into the coronal heating and solar wind acceleration processes. As these processes occur in the near-Sun region of the corona, PSP will have its closest perihelion at 9.86~solar radii (0.0459~au) \citep{Fox2015}. It will be the first spacecraft flying and measuring in situ solar wind this close to the Sun. Its planned observations range from the perihelion up to \SI{0.25}{\au}, leaving the outer part for data transfer, as \citet{Fox2015} state in their description of PSP's mission design.\\

%difference to other models
There are many studies analyzing the solar wind dependence on solar activity and heliocentric distance with Helios data (\citet{Schwenn1983, Bougeret1984, Schwenn1990}, more cites?). They examine average values, additionally distinguishing between slow and fast wind. In this paper we instead look at the variations of the whole frequency distributions, consider solar activity and extrapolate these to the near-Sun region.\\


%definition of sw environment
\section{Solar wind environment}

%solar wind parameters
The goal of this paper is to estimate the solar wind environment PSP will probe during its orbits. We regard the solar wind primarily as a proton plasma, because protons make up most of it. The average helium abundance is only about \SI{4.5}{\percent} and in slow wind at solar cycle minimum even less than \SI{2}{\percent} \citep{Feldman1978,Schwenn1983,Kasper2012}. Neglecting heavier ions, the electron and mass density can be derived accordingly.

Generally, the characteristic behavior of a plasma is determined by its \textit{density}, \textit{temperature} and \textit{magnetic field strength}. Furthermore, the bulk \textit{velocity} is the parameter which makes the plasma a 'wind'. For our study we define the solar wind environment as the four major solar wind parameters. Quantities like flux densities, mass flux and plasma beta can directly be derived from those four parameters.

In addition, the velocity is the defining parameter of the two types of solar wind. Solar wind mostly consists of and switches between slow and fast wind, whose ratio highly depends on solar activity. These types have different characteristics and their interactions lead to phenomena such as interaction regions. Additionally there also are coronal mass ejections (CMEs) embedded, whose occurrence rate follows solar activity too. Their share varies between almost zero in cycle minimum up to a half in maximum \citep{Richardson2012}. This study averages over these internal solar wind structures.

%frequency distribution data
One cannot know which specific solar wind type or structure PSP will encounter at a given point in time, so we extrapolate the parameters' probability distributions from existing solar wind measurements.

Our approach is to get an analytical representation of the frequency distributions' shapes, their solar activity dependence and their solar distance scaling. We get the parameters' frequency distributions and solar activity dependence from near-Earth solar wind and sunspot number (SSN) time series with a duration of almost five solar cycles and their distance dependency from solar wind measurements of more than half a solar cycle, covering more than two third of the distance to the Sun (\SIrange{0.29}{0.98}{\au}).%0.68~au\\

From the combination of the obtained frequency distributions, SSN dependence functions and solar distance dependence functions we build a general model representing the solar activity and distance behavior of all four solar wind parameter frequencies.

This general model is then fed with a SSN prediction and extrapolated to PSP's planned orbital positions.\\

\section{Frequency distributions}
\label{sec:frequency_distribution}

This section looks at the solar wind parameters' frequency distributions which we extract from the in situ OMNI data set. We determine adequate fit function types and evaluate how suitable they are to represent the frequencies' shapes.

\subsection{OMNI frequency data}
\label{sec:omni_frequency_data}
The solar wind parameters are highly variable, due to short-term variations from structures like slow and fast wind streams, interaction regions and CMEs, whose rate and properties depend on solar activity. Hence, for deriving general frequency distributions of the solar wind parameters, averaging over long-term solar wind variations is needed. This requires a distance-independent data set covering multiple solar cycles. The abundance of near-Earth hourly OMNI data is well suited for this task, because it spans almost five solar cycles.

%about OMNI data
This OMNI~2 data set \citep{King2005} combines solar wind plasma and magnetic field data and for this study not important energetic proton fluxes, geomagnetic and solar indices. Because it covers decades, the near-Earth solar wind data is composed of intercalibrated multi-spacecraft data which is time-shifted to the nose of the Earth's bow shock.

%data source
The data is obtained from the OMNIWeb interface\footnote{\url{http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/}} at NASA's Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF), Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).

%data time range
The hourly data of the whole time range up to \mbox{2016-12-31} is the basis for the frequency fits. The data starts in \mbox{1963-11-27}, but the temperature data not before \mbox{1965-07-26}. The data coverage of the parameters is between \SIrange{67}{74}{\percent}, which adds up to about 36--40~years in total. This plethora of data is well suited for our task.

% T: 66.73 \%		36.03 y\\

%hourly data
We note that the use of higher time resolution instead, would not significantly change our results. The frequency distributions of the also available minutely OMNI data set are almost congruent with the hourly---they only differ slightly at their extreme ends.

%data binning
We specify bin sizes considering the individual maximal parameter ranges and the OMNI data precision. Especially for the density and temperature we choose their bin sizes such small that their distributions' peaks can be resolved (the peaks are at their lower end). We set the individual bin sizes to \SI{0.5}{nT} for the magnetic field strength, \SI{10}{\km\per\s} for the velocity, \SI{1}{\per\cm\cubed} for the density and \SI{10000}{\K} for the temperature.

Next, we look for a suitable fit function for the resulting histogram shape of the solar wind parameters' frequency distributions.

\subsection{Lognormal fitting}
%choice of distribution function---why lognormal function?
Obviously all possible values for the four parameters are positive. This hints to the supposition that they are lognormally distributed, as many positive natural quantities conform to lognormal distributions. Its probability density function is described by a lognormal function.
%fitting method
Therefore we use a lognormal function as the fit function in the process of the least squares regression fitting.
%fit function
The lognormal function
\begin{align}
	W(x) &= \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi} x} \, \exp\left(- \frac{\left(\ln x - \mu\right)^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right)	\label{eq:lognormal_function}
\end{align}
depends on the location $\mu$ and the shape parameter $\sigma$. Changes in $\mu$ affect both the horizontal and vertical scaling of the function whereas $\sigma$ influences its shape. The distribution's median $x_\text{med}$ and mean $x_\text{avg}$ (average) positions are easier to interprete and can directly be calculated from $\mu$ and $\sigma$:
\begin{align}
	x_\text{med} &= \exp\left(\mu\right)	&	&\Longleftrightarrow	&	\mu &= \ln\left(x_\text{med}\right)\,,	\label{eq:lognormal_median}\\
	x_\text{avg} &= \exp\left(\mu + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)	&	&\Longleftrightarrow	&	\sigma &= \sqrt{2 \ln\left(\frac{x_\text{avg}}{x_\text{med}}\right)}\,.	\label{eq:lognormal_mean}
\end{align}
It is apparent that the mean is always larger than the median. Replacing the variables $\mu$ and $\sigma$ with these relations, the lognormal function~(\ref{eq:lognormal_function}) becomes
\begin{align}
	W(x) = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\pi \ln\left(\frac{x_\text{avg}}{x_\text{med}}\right)} \, x} \, \exp\left(- \frac{\ln^2\left(\frac{x}{x_\text{med}}\right)}{4 \ln\left(\frac{x_\text{avg}}{x_\text{med}}\right)}\right)\,.	\label{eq:single_lognormal_fit_function}
\end{align}
The values of $x_\text{med}$ and $x_\text{avg}$ obtained from fitting the solar wind frequency distributions are listed in Table~\ref{tab:lognormal_fit_parameters}.
\begin{table*}
	\caption{Resulting fit coefficients from the fitting of the lognormal function (\ref{eq:single_lognormal_fit_function}) to the shape of the solar wind parameters' frequency distributions at \SI{1}{\au}.

From visual inspection, the resulting curves match well with the shape of the magnetic field strength, density and temperature distributions (Fig.~\ref{fig:histogram_fits_4_a_zoom_paper_pdfplot}). However, for the velocity the fit function seems insufficient in describing its more complex shape, especially at its peak position and the faster end of the distribution. Its sum of absolute residuals (SAR) between data and fit is almost three times larger than those from the other parameters (Table~\ref{tab:lognormal_fit_parameters}). They can be compared, because the area of probability density functions is unity.

\end{figure*}

%double lognormal fitting
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%justification for compositional lognormal fit
To reach a better fit result for the velocity we change the fit function. We do not want to abandon the well-founded application of the lognormal function. However, it is reasonable to assume that the velocity distribution is composed of at least two branches (slow and fast). Therefore a compositional approach promises better fit results, which is why we combine two lognormal functions (\ref{eq:single_lognormal_fit_function}), bearing the disadvantage of more fit variables:
\begin{align}
	W_\text{II}(x) &= c \cdot W_1(x) + (1 -c) \cdot W_2(x)\,.	\label{eq:double_lognormal_fit_function}
\end{align}
The balancing parameter $c$ ensures that the resulting function remains normalized as it represents a probability distribution.

The fitting of $W_\text{II}(x)$ to the velocity's frequency distribution gives the values of the now five fit parameters ($c$, $x_\text{med,1}$, $x_\text{avg,1}$, $x_\text{med,2}$ and $x_\text{avg,2}$), which are also listed in Table~\ref{tab:lognormal_fit_parameters} together with the median and mean of the composed distribution, which can be derived via solving
\begin{align}
	\int W_\text{II}(x)\,\text{d}x = 0	&	&\text{and}	&	&\int x\,W_\text{II}(x)\,\text{d}x = 0
\end{align}
respectively.\\
As anticipated, this more complex fit function is more accurate in describing the velocity's frequency distribution (see Fig.~\ref{fig:histogram_fits_V_a_zoom_dbl_paper_pdfplot}).
\begin{figure}
	\resizebox{\hsize}{!}{\includegraphics{figures/histogram_fits_V_a_zoom_dbl_paper_pdfplot.pdf}}
	\caption{Plot of the velocity's frequency distribution (same as in Fig.~\ref{fig:histogram_fits_4_a_zoom_paper_pdfplot}) and its compositional lognormal fit. The fit's median and mean values and its two fit parts are indicated as well. The inset only has a zoomed-in frequency axis, its x-axis stays the same.}
	\label{fig:histogram_fits_V_a_zoom_dbl_paper_pdfplot}
\end{figure}
That is why we keep using the double lognormal ansatz for the velocity frequency fits in the following sections.\\
In this static model the slow and fast part contribute almost equally ($c \approx 0.5$), which of course is only valid for this kind of long-term average. At different times in a solar cycle their contributions vary strongly.

%transition
For the bulk of the solar wind these static lognormal functions describe the parameters' distributions well. This is different for the extreme values (which may also stem from CMEs). The simple lognormal fit models of the magnetic field strength, the velocity and the density underestimate their frequency at the high value tails, whereas the temperature's tail is overestimated (see insets of Fig.~\ref{fig:histogram_fits_4_a_zoom_paper_pdfplot}). The velocity's compositional lognormal fit only slightly overestimates its tail (inset in Fig.~\ref{fig:histogram_fits_V_a_zoom_dbl_paper_pdfplot}).

Short-term variations in the solar wind cannot be predicted, but their occurrence rate can. It depends on solar activity, which changes cyclically and thus can be forecasted to a certain degree---at least within a solar cycle.


\section{Solar activity variations}
\label{sec:solar_activity_variations}
This section aims to relate changes in the four solar wind parameters to general solar activity. For this we examine their correlations to the yearly sunspot number and determine the lag times with the highest coefficients. Next, we fit lognormal functions to the frequency distributions like before, but implement linear relations to the yearly SSN to shift the distributions. Only for the velocity the approach is different in that its two components are kept fixed and instead their balance is modified with changing SSN.

\subsection{SSN data}
Solar activity is commonly measured via the sunspot number. We want to correlate OMNI in situ measurements with the SSN, yet OMNI data are from Earth orbit, causing variations in solar latitude and distance. To dodge these seasonal variations we use yearly OMNI and SSN data.

The international sunspot number (\citeyear{sidc}) is retrieved from the online catalogue\footnote{\url{http://www.sidc.be/silso/}} at the World Data Center -- Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (WDC-SILSO), Solar Influences Data Analysis Center (SIDC), Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB).

%seasonal influence contained within yearly frequency distributions\\

\subsection{SSN correlation}
Our current interest lies in the correlation of the SSN to the solar wind median values, because the median defines the position of a lognormal function. The yearly OMNI parameter medians and the yearly SSN are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:OMNI_yearly_ssn_correlation_c_plot}.

%solar activity = SSN $\neq$ solar cycle\\
The solar wind velocity and its close friends density and temperature are known to depend on the state of the solar cycle \citep{Schwenn1983}, which is why they follow the SSN indirectly (with time lag).
%density modulation with SSN \citep{Schwenn1983} p.~499\\
Thus we derive the correlation coefficients for different time lags between solar wind parameters and SSN (see Fig.~\ref{fig:OMNI_yearly_ssn_correlation_c_plot}).
\begin{figure}
	\resizebox{\hsize}{!}{\includegraphics{figures/OMNI_yearly_ssn_correlation_c_plot.pdf}}
	\caption{Plot of the solar wind parameter yearly medians from OMNI data and the yearly SSN from the \citet{sidc} with cycle number (top). Their correlation coefficients with the yearly SSN for time lags back to -15 years (bottom).}
	\label{fig:OMNI_yearly_ssn_correlation_c_plot}
\end{figure}

The highest correlation coefficient for the magnetic field strength is 0.728. It is without lag time and the highest of all solar wind parameters, which is expected because the SSN is directly proportional to the solar surface magnetic flux (cite?).\\
Velocity and temperature have a lag time of 3~years with their maximal correlation coefficients (0.453 and 0.540). The density has a lag time of 6~years (0.468), which is in agreement with the by \citet{Bougeret1984} documented density anticorrelation with SSN.\\	%p.~406\\

% maximal correlation coefficients and their lag times:\\
% magnetic field strength: lag 0, 0.728\\
% velocity: lag -3, 0.453\\
% density: lag -6, 0.468\\
% temperature: lag -3, 0.540\\
For all parameters their correlation coefficients' amplitudes decline with increasing lag time and, as expected, show a frequency of about 11~years.
cite literature to lag time...\\

\subsection{SSN fitting}
\label{sec:ssn_fitting}
To be able to shift the distributions with SSN, we add a linear SSN dependency to the median
\begin{align}
	x_\text{med}(ssn) &= a_\text{med} \cdot ssn + b_\text{med}\,,	\label{eq:median_with_ssn}
\end{align}
using a factor to the SSN $a_\text{med}$ with a baseline $b_\text{med}$. We relate the mean with a scaling factor to the median to transfer its SSN dependency:
\begin{align}
	x_\text{avg}(ssn) &= (1 + a_\text{avg}) \cdot x_\text{med}(ssn)\,.	\label{eq:mean_with_ssn}
\end{align}
With the implementation of these relations into the lognormal function (\ref{eq:single_lognormal_fit_function}), the new dynamic fit function $W'(x,ssn)$ is then fitted to the yearly data. The three resulting fit coefficients ($a_\text{med}, b_\text{med}$ and $a_\text{avg}$) are presented in Table~\ref{tab:ssn_fit_parameters}.
\begin{table*}
	\caption{Resulting fit coefficients from the data fitting with lagged SSN. For the velocity the fit parameters from the double lognormal fit and their balancing function are given. The values in brackets are the estimated standard deviation of each fit parameter.}

Naturally, the fit models match with the general data trends, though single year variations are not able to be replicated by the model (e.g. the high velocity and temperature values in 1974, 1994 and 2003) (see Fig.~\ref{fig:OMNI_yearly_BVdblNTSSN_fit_d_plot}).
\begin{figure*}

	\label{fig:OMNI_yearly_BVdblNTSSN_fit_d_plot}
\end{figure*}
The comparison with the yearly data median values over SSN shows that the from the model obtained medians have a quite similar slope (see Fig.~\ref{fig:OMNI_yearly_BVNTvsSSN}).\\
\begin{figure}
	\resizebox{\hsize}{!}{\includegraphics{figures/OMNI_yearly_BVNTvsSSN.pdf}}
	\caption{Solar wind parameter median over lagged SSN. The yearly data medians (+) with their weighted linear fit (solid) are obtained from OMNI data. The error bars denote the SSN standard deviation and the relative weight from the yearly data coverage. The SSN dependent median (\ref{eq:median_with_ssn}) is from the lognormal model fit (dashed). For the velocity the SSN independent slow and fast model parts are plotted instead (dotted).}
	\label{fig:OMNI_yearly_BVNTvsSSN}
\end{figure}

Again, the velocity gets a special treatment with the double lognormal distribution (\ref{eq:double_lognormal_fit_function}). It is known that slow and fast solar wind stream occurrence rates follow the solar cycle, yet their magnitudes stay fairly stable (cite?). Thus we keep the two velocity components' positions constant and vary instead their balance with the SSN:
\begin{align}
	c(ssn) &= c_a \cdot ssn + c_b\,.	\label{eq:balance_with_ssn}
\end{align}
The fit result (see Table~\ref{tab:ssn_fit_parameters}) is a model in which three years after solar cycle minimum (SSN of zero) the slow solar wind has a share of almost two-thirds and decreases further with increasing SSN (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Vdbl_SSN_ratio_f_plot}).\\

% 3 years after minimum (SSN of zero) the slow wind has its maximal share of 0.638(32). 3 years after maximum (SSN of 200) it has only a share of 0.278(37).\\
To compare the ratios of slow to fast wind between model and data, we simply apply the commonly used constant velocity threshold of $v_\text{th} = \SI{400}{\km\per\s}$ (cite?). The linear fit to the yearly data ratio and the derived model ratio are quite similar (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Vdbl_SSN_ratio_f_plot}). Specific velocity thresholds between slow and fast solar wind cannot be directly compared with the somewhat steeper balance parameter of this model. The model's balance may represent the actual ratios of the solar wind types in a more realistic way than a specific velocity threshold does, as the velocity ranges of both types overlap (cites? - there exists slow sw with properties of fast wind and vice versa...).

In comparison with the data the velocity fit model also matches with the general trend (see Fig.~\ref{fig:OMNI_yearly_BVdblNTSSN_fit_d_plot}).\\

\section{Solar distance dependency}
\label{sec:solar_distance_dependency}
In this section we use Helios data to obtain exponential fit functions for the heliocentric distance dependency and also evaluate the fits' extrapolation behavior in direction to the Sun. To fit the bulk solar wind distributions' distance dependency we use the frequency fitting method from Sect.~\ref{sec:frequency_distribution} on distance-binned Helios data. This results in models comprising of exponentially with distance shifted lognormal functions.

%Helios data
\subsection{Helios distance data}
\label{sec:helios_distance_data}
The Helios probes were the only spacecraft measuring in situ solar wind over large solar distance ranges in the inner heliosphere. We use the combined data from both Helios~1 and Helios~2 probes. Helios~1's (Helios~2's) highly elliptical orbit in the ecliptic covered a solar distance range of \SIrange{0.31}{0.98}{\au} (\SIrange{0.29}{0.98}{\au}). Launched during solar cycle minimum, the data of both probes cover the rise to the maximum of cycle 21 ($\sim$6.5~years at varying distances).

%hourly data
Again we choose data with hourly resolution to allow its use along with the hourly OMNI data. As \citet{Schwenn1983} pointed out, the many hourly Helios data points which contain only a few measurements, contribute with a larger scatter to the frequency distributions, nevertheless their effect is insignificant in the treatment of the bulk data.	%\citet[p.~491]{Schwenn1983} 

Helios~1's (Helios~2's) merged hourly data set from the magnetometer and plasma instruments \citep{Rosenbauer1977} includes $\sim$12.5~orbits ($\sim$8~orbits) in the time range \mbox{1974-12-10} to \mbox{1981-06-14} (\mbox{1976-01-01} to \mbox{1980-03-04}).
%Helios plasma instrument (E1); Helios magnetometer instrument (E2)
% Helios data ranges:\\
% - time range Helios~1 [1974-12-10--1981-06-14] (12.5~orbits), Helios~2 [1976-01-01--1980-03-04] (8~orbits)\\
% - solar distance range Helios~1 0.31--0.98~au, Helios~2 0.29--0.98~au\\
%data sources
The Helios data was retrieved from the Coordinated~Data~Analysis~Web (CDAWeb) interface at NASA's GSFC/SPDF\footnote{\url{http://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/}}.

The Helios~1 (Helios~2) magnetometer data coverage is about 43~\% (54~\%) and amounts to 2.8~years (2.3~years) in total. The plasma data coverage is 76~\% (92~\%) and amounts to 5.0~years (3.9~years) in total.
% temporal coverage of merged data\\
% Helios 1: 1974-12-10--1981-06-14; 6y6m15d = 2388~d = 6.538~y\\
% Mag data coverage: 42.6~\%; 2.785~years\\
% Plasma data coverage: 76.4~\%; 4.995~years\\
% Helios 2: 1976-01-01--1980-03-04; 4y3m4d = 1557~d = 4.263~y\\
% Mag data coverage: 54.4~\%; 2.319~years (83~\% of H1)\\
% Plasma data coverage: 91.8~\%; 3.913~years (78~\% of H1)\\
Thus, the Helios data cover only fractions of a solar cycle and cannot be used for deriving representative time-independent solar wind multi-cycle conditions like the OMNI data can.

%Helios data biased towards solar minimum
Using this data, we also have to keep in mind that its time coverage is unequally distributed over the solar cycle. Dividing the data by the transition from cycle minimum to maximum (mid 1977) and considering the data gap distributions, the Helios data covers about \SI{68}{\percent} during cycle minimum whereas during maximum only \SI{38}{\percent}.\\

For calculating the median and mean values at different solar distances the data is binned into \SI{0.01}{\au} bins, which is also the native precision in this data set.\\

\subsection{Exponential fitting}
%why exponential function?
An exponential distance behavior is expected from all four parameters (cites?). Therefore we use the exponential function
\begin{align}
	x(r) = d\,r^e	\label{eq:exponential_function}
\end{align}
with the solar distance $r$ for the regression fit of the median and mean. The fits are weighted by data counts per bin.
%fit result table and figure
With $r$ in astronomical units we get the fit coefficients ($d_\text{med}$, $d_\text{avg}$, $e_\text{med}$ and $e_\text{avg}$) as given in Table~\ref{tab:mean_median_fit_parameter}.\\
\begin{table*}
	\caption{These are the fit coefficients for the median and mean solar distance dependencies of the four parameters from the combined Helios data set. The errors in brackets are the estimated standard deviations of each fit parameter. The crossing distance is the point where the fitted median and mean intersect.}

\end{table*}

%crossing distances
The next step is to fit the bulk of the solar wind parameters with lognormal functions. At all considered solar distances the mean of the three plasma parameters is larger than their median (Fig.~\ref{fig:radial_fit_4_thesis_light_skip_pdfcairo_plot}).
\begin{figure*}
	\includegraphics[width=18cm]{figures/radial_fit_4_thesis_light_skip_pdfcairo_plot.pdf}
	\caption{Helios hourly data plots of the four solar wind parameters over solar distance. The mean and median per \SI{0.01}{\au} data bin and their fit curves are plotted as well. The Helios data has a native distance resolution of \SI{0.01}{\au}. To make the abundance visible in these plots, we added a random distance value of up to \SI{+-0.005}{\au}.}
	\label{fig:radial_fit_4_thesis_light_skip_pdfcairo_plot}
\end{figure*}
However, the magnetic field strength's mean crosses the median at \SI{0.339}{\au} (Table~\ref{tab:mean_median_fit_parameter}) and is lower at smaller distances. At the crossing point and below the magnetic field strength can therefore not be described anymore with a lognormal function. For an extrapolation to the PSP perihelion the same happens for the temperature at \SI{0.082}{\au}.

The large velocity's crossing distance and its large error indicate that the median's and mean's distance behavior can be kept identical and so the frequency's shape distance independent.

Those crossings limit the possible extrapolation distances with lognormal functions. To circumvent these limitations for all four solar wind parameters we set the exponents $e_\text{med}$ and $e_\text{avg}$ to be identical, avoiding crossing of median and mean. Then the distribution's width is constant and scales only exponentially with solar distance. Applying this approximation, we have to accept larger model errors, especially for the magnetic field strength. It also limits the extrapolation accuracy.

\subsection{Exponential lognormal fitting}
To retrieve the frequency distributions for every \SI{0.01}{\au} solar distance bin, we choose the same solar wind parameter binning as with the OMNI data (Sect.~\ref{sec:omni_frequency_data}).
% Helios histogram bin sizes for mean of frequency distribution (at specific solar distance):\\
% $B$: bin size 0.5~nT, min 337, mean precision: 0.000545\\
% $v$: bin size 1~cm$^{-3}$, min 497, mean precision: 0.00449\\
% $n$: bin size 10~km/s, min 497, mean precision:  0.00449\\
% $T$: bin size 10\,000~K, min 497, mean precision: 4.49--44.49\\

As mentioned before, we set the exponents of median and average to be identical. Implementing the exponential distance dependency~(\ref{eq:exponential_function}) into the lognormal function (\ref{eq:single_lognormal_fit_function}), we get three fit parameters ($d'_\text{med}$, $d'_\text{avg}$ and the common exponent $e'$).

Naturally, we use the double lognormal function~(\ref{eq:double_lognormal_fit_function}) for the velocity distribution fit, resulting in $W''_\text{II}(x,r)$. The additional fit parameters are the balancing parameter $c'$ and from the second lognormal part $d'_\text{med,2}$ and $d'_\text{avg,2}$. The resulting fit coefficients for the four solar wind parameters are presented in Table~\ref{tab:extrapolation_model_fit_parameters}.
\begin{table*}
	\caption{These are the resulting fit coefficients with the single lognormal exponential function, respectively double lognormal for the velocity. The errors in brackets are the estimated standard deviations of each fit parameter.}

\end{table*}

With $c' = 0.557$ the velocity balancing parameter is of an expected value similar to that obtained from the Helios time period (the mean SSN during the Helios period was 59, this corresponds to $c(59) = 0.53$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:Vdbl_SSN_ratio_f_plot}).\\

The fit models seem to resemble the data quite well (Fig.~\ref{fig:mixed_fit_fixed_4_paper_e_plot}). The magnetic field strength frequency is more focused (around \SI{40}{nT}) at the lower distance boundary than the model's is. This is expected because of our fixed distance independent shape approximation.\\

	\includegraphics[width=18cm]{figures/mixed_fit_fixed_4_paper_e_plot.pdf}

	\label{fig:mixed_fit_fixed_4_paper_e_plot}
\end{figure*}

The velocity and temperature models' upper values have a higher frequency than the data shows. This is due to the systematic fit discrepancy of the lognormal distribution's high value tails (see zoom box in Fig.~\ref{fig:histogram_fits_4_a_zoom_paper_pdfplot}).\\

Finally, we combine the obtained solar activity and distance dependencies for shifting the frequency distributions. The result is an empirical solar wind model for the inner heliosphere.\\

%are the exponents time-independent?
Under the assumption that the exponential fall-off laws do not change with time/solar activity (as shown above...), they can be used in general.

We combine the fit coefficients of the median relation for solar activity dependence (\ref{eq:median_with_ssn}) with the ones from the exponential distance dependence (previous section)
\begin{align}
	x_\text{med}(ssn,r) &= (a_\text{med} \cdot ssn + b_\text{med}) \cdot r^{e'}
\end{align}

to get the combined model function $W'''(x,ssn,r)$. And for the velocity $W_\text{II}'''(x,ssn,r)$ with the double lognormal function.\\

%model errors
give model errors sizes/uncertainties (sigmas); $W'''_\text{err}(x,ssn,r)$, $x_\text{med\_err}(ssn,r)$\\

model requirements:\\
- modeling the frequency distribution with sufficient accuracy -> error size (changing distribution shape with distance)\\
- modeling the distance dependency with sufficient accuracy -> error size (different scaling law at smaller distances?)\\
- possibility to extrapolate model down to 0.0459~au\\

%model limits
model limits (spherical coordinates):\\
- heliocentric distance range 0.29--0.98~au\\
- rotational symmetry\\
- confined to ecliptic +-7.2 degrees\\
model constrictions:\\
- solar distance dependency function\\
- frequency distribution functions\\
- neglected influence from heliolatitude variation\\


\section{Model extrapolation to PSP orbital time and position}
To estimate the solar wind environment at PSP's planned orbital positions during its mission time, SSN predictions are included into the general solar wind model and extrapolations to the PSP perihelion region are performed.\\

\subsection{SSN prediction for PSP mission time}
%SSN prediction
For the SSN prediction there are several sources available. The SIDC provides 12-month SSN forecasts\footnote{\url{http://sidc.be/silso/forecasts}} obtained from different methods (e.g. Kalman filter combined method). The Space Weather Prediction Center's (SWPC) prediction follows a consensus of the Solar~Cycle~24 Prediction~Panel\footnote{\url{http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-cycle-progression}} (until end of 2019).

For the prediction of the next solar cycle~25 we simply assume a course similar to the last and thus we shift the last cycle by 11~years. Additionally we consider the two alternatives of half and twice its amplitude. The SSN for PSP's first perihelion will be small---certainly below 20, whereas its nearest perihelia, which commence at the height of cycle~25, will have as of now almost unpredictable SSN amplitudes (see Fig.~\ref{fig:SPP_orbit_predicted_SSN_overview_d_plot})\\

\subsection{Near-Sun extrapolation for PSP orbit}

%PSP orbit
PSP orbit description, seven Venus flybys, within Venus' orbital plane? (\SI{3.86}{\degree} to Sun's equator), \citep{Fox2015}, (see Fig.~\ref{fig:SPP_orbit_predicted_SSN_overview_d_plot})\\

The extrapolation distance is only about one third of the model range, but as the parameters follow exponential change, one has to look at the logarithmic distance which is indeed one and a half times the model range.\\

extrapolation errors...\\
Comparison with existing near-Sun models (renew extrapolation figure to 1-column; with half/twice SSN)\\
calculate or set min, avg and max SSN (e.g. 0, 100, 200)\\

velocity:\\
%critical surfaces
Alfvénic critical surface i.e. source surface (see Fox before 2.1)\\
in direction to the Sun is at $\sim$2.5~Rs the source surface (Schatten1969)\\
sonic and Alfvénic critical point positions (see \citet{Sittler1999})\\
sonic point and slow solar wind origin \citep{Sheeley1997}\\
approaching these regions, acceleration plays a role\\

The near-Sun (PSP perihelion) solar wind velocity is expected to be slower than our model's estimates, because the position of the source (Alfvénic critical) surface is predicted to lie between 15--30~Rs (Schatten1969, Sittler1999, Exarhos2000, Katsikas2010, Goelzer2014; choose references...), up to which the solar wind is believed to be accelerated.\\

density:\\
\citet{Leblanc1998} -> electron density model derived from type~III radio burst observations\\
The density distance dependency scales with $r^{-2}$, but steepens below 10~Rs with $r^{-6}$ \citep{Leblanc1998}.\\

magnetic field and temperature:\\
crossing distance effect\\

\citet{Wang2000}, sources of slow solar wind + IMF regulation mechanism + blobs; compare with our slow V lognormal part\\

% comparison with other Helios studies (Schwenn, Bougeret)
\citet{Schwenn1983,Schwenn1990}, who derived the distance dependencies for both Helios spacecraft separately ($v_\text{H1}(r) \propto r^{0.083}$ and $v_\text{H2}(r) \propto r^{0.036}$), average or median? fits well...\\
Helios results, radial gradients see \citet{Schwenn1990} p.~155\\

The electron density distance function, which \citet{Bougeret1984} derived from Helios data and normed to the 1976 1~au density ($n(r) = 6.14\,r^{-2.10(4)}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$) also fits well...\\

\citet{Sheeley1997} -> LASCO coronagraph observed speed profile of coronal features tracing the slow solar wind, 2--30~Rs\\
- parabolic eq.~(2) and exponential eq.~(3)\\
- sonic point 5--6~Rs\\
- slow solar wind origin 3--4~Rs\\

The model of \citet{Sittler1999} is based on Skylab coronagraph and Ulysses data. it is a 2d semiempirical MHD model (time static)\\
L-> compare with their radial density function eq. (18a); B-field function eq. (19a+b); V(r) eq. (24); T(r)...\\

\subsection{PSP solar wind environment estimation}
Implementing the orbital distance data and predicted SSN for the mission time we get PSP's estimated solar wind environment $W'''(x,ssn,r)$.\\
The zoom into the first and the nearest perihelia show which solar wind parameter magnitudes can be expected there (Figs.~\ref{fig:SPP_perihelia_prediction_d_plot} and \ref{fig:SPP_perihelia_prediction_nearest_d_plot}).\\

error estimation for general model and extreme value tendencies\\

error sources:\\
- extrapolation\\
- lognormal model\\
- SSN variance\\

all estimates outside these boundaries are extrapolations with large uncertainties.\\

discuss high value zoom figures\\

The solar wind parameters vary with solar distance as well as with latitudinal separation from the heliospheric current sheet (HCS).\\
The OMNI data is time-shifted to the nose of the Earth's bow shock. This leads to yearly solar distance variations of \SI{>2}{\percent} (cite?) as the Earth orbits the Sun. Furthermore, its orbit within the ecliptic leads to a yearly variation of \SI{+-7.2}{\degree} in heliospheric latitude.\\
The HCS's position in latitude is highly variable around the solar equator \citep[p.~127~ff.?]{Schwenn1990}.\\

Error estimation over the year (seasonal/monthly) -> we expect variations to be less than 5~\%\\


%OMNI data is not corrected for solar distace. only available for 1-/5-min data\\

%[limited parameter ranges... (minV: 171~km/s; Schwenn1983)]\\

- empirical solar wind model for inner heliosphere within ecliptic\\
- low velocity at 0.0459~au\\
- slow/fast ratio SSN dependency\\
- application validity of lognormal distributions\\
--> B inversion of frequency distribution\\
---> magnetic field distribution's with distance increasing high value tail -> source are compression regions (why with density no increase?); look into Parker1958's B-field formula...\\
varying shape with distance is indicator for internal physical processes (mixing/turbulence...)\\

individual velocity part discussion -> there is no specific velocity threshold between slow and fast solar wind types, the velocity ranges of both types overlap.\\
\citet{Sanchez-Diaz2016} (very slow solar wind)\\
Not only the slowest wind but also the fastest wind is expected to converge to the average speed (Sanchez-Diaz2016 p.~2835, using MHD-model -> very slow solar wind is continuation of slow wind) (because of interaction).\\

The ratio of both varies with solar activity, e.g. 3~years after maximum, polar coronal holes are observed to often have equatorial extensions (cite?). see and use \citet{Bougeret1984} p.~498...\\

larger influx from higher latitudes (see figure b))\\

In most studies the density distance dependence is assumed to scale with $r^{-2}$ (cites), assuming a constant velocity.\\


\section{Conclusions}

Further investigations should be done into structure extrapolations; outward extension of model to Mars seems feasable...\\

Further questions:\\
nearer to the Sun (at and below the source surface) the solar wind expansion in the ecliptic should be less spherical but more circular due to the influx from higher latitudes. => density exponent > -2\\
