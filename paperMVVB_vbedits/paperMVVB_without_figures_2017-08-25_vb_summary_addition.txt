
The limitations of the extrapolated values at distances below 20 R 
indicate the occurrence of solar wind acceleration and heating 
processes. PSP will thus be able to directly measure these processes as 
planned. Note that the study of extreme solar wind parameters associated 
with extreme CMEs was beyond the scope of this study as well as an 
estimate of the level of turbulence increasing with distance to the Sun 
as observed by the Helios probes inside individual solar wind streams.
