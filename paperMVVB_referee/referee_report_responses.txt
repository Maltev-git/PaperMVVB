Referee Report

This paper discusses a method of using OMNI and Helios solar wind data to estimate the solar wind parameters that might be expected during the upcoming Parker Solar Probe mission. It includes an estimate of how these parameters might vary with solar cycle, though this is a relatively small correction, and the likely sunspot number during the mission is anyway highly uncertain. The analysis appears to be thorough, retaining information on the log-normal distribution of the parameters that is used to produce “model” representations of the distributions and their variation during the solar cycle. However, in the end, this information isn’t used in the predictions at PSP, where only median values are considered. It’s also not clear whether this type of analysis has any advantage over say a simple-minded approach where you use the radial dependence of averaged Helios values to propagate averaged 1 AU values, perhaps taken at different times in the solar cycle, down to the PSP orbit. My suspicion is that the results might not be all that different, but the authors might like to address this point. The extrapolated values do appear to be fairly consistent with previous estimates of near Sun parameters, and deviations, e.g. in the speed profile can be plausibly accounted for, so the results appear to be reasonable. 

- ...
+ use the distributions for the predictions (add perihelia figures of distributions)
+ state advantage over simple-minded approach (example of simple-minded approach; state how different the results are)
+ maybe stress Helios data bias to cycle minimum (section 4, third paragraph)

Some steps in the procedure could be explained more clearly in the text, as noted below, and the tables are rather cryptic since the meaning of the various parameters is not always clear. If they are fit parameters, it would be helpful to state the function that is being fitted in the table. There are conclusions and summary sections that both, yet again, go through the analysis procedure, which is unnecessary. They could be combined. There are also useful functions that give the radial dependences of the parameters that are only shown in the summary section. They could be included in the main results section. 

- procedural steps explained in detail, following the specific comments
- clarified the meaning of the parameters in the tables
- linked the fit equations in the table captions
- combined the conclusion and summary sections
- moved final functions into section 5
+ procedural steps to be explained in detail
+ clarify the meaning of the parameters in tables
+ link the fit equations in table captions
+ combine conclusion and summary sections
+ include final functions in results section

The English is reasonable overall, but there are a number of cases where a long phrase is used as an adjective. Suggestions have been made to rephrase these sentences.

Overall, I anticipate that the paper will be acceptable for publication after the comments in this review are considered. 



Specific Points:

Page 2, Results, line 5: Suggest: Since the modeled velocity and temperature values below about 20 Rs appear overestimated in comparison with existing observations, this suggests that PSP will directly measure solar wind acceleration and heating processes below 20 Rs as planned.

Introduction, line 8: “Until today” is unnecessary – suggest removing. SOHO is also at L1 and returns solar wind observations from CELIAS. But maybe it’s not necessary to list the spacecraft, especially as other spacecraft not listed contributed earlier observations to OMNI.

+ highlighted
+ look into that

Page 8, last paragraph, line 2: Maybe avoid the word "correlated" since it is used below, and there is no correlation here. E.g., … fast solar wind occurs at times when polar coronal holes extend to lower latitudes, a typical feature of the declining phase of the solar cycle as pointed out by..... Therefore... exhibit time lags relative to the SSN maxima.

Three lines below table and following: I find this step difficult to follow. It seems that the sunspot numbers are shifted according to the lags, and there is some fit to the data which is then used to produce a model of the particular parameter as a function of SSN, but the text doesn't explain the motivation (apparently to produce a "model" distribution as a function of SSN) procedure very clearly.

Last paragraph of page: “As anticipated…” - especially since the same data are used! Also give the results in the text to make the comparison easier with the values given in this paragraph. 

- removed 'As anticipated'
- added exponents into text
+ highlighted

+ is both sufficient?

Page 14, last paragraph, line 6: The curves are still very close together after the crossing, so is this an important feature? 

+ highlighted
+ if median and mean are of similar values, this is an indication that the distribution is symmetrical (gaussian perhaps?)

Line 8: But this distance (0.082 AU) is beyond the range shown in the figure, and the data, so is it reliable? I don't understand the comment "therefore the extrapolation of the magnetic field and temperature distribution frequencies to the PSP orbit by applying lognormal functions is limited. What does “limited” mean? Perhaps the comment arises because the mean is larger than the median for a log normal distribution, as noted several pages earlier, and so this crossing indicates that the distribution is no longer log normal. Maybe a few more words of explanation would help the reader understand this point, and the significance of the crossing point. 

- explained more clearly
+ highlighted
+ what does limited mean?
+ limited in the sense of a correct distribution shape

+ is it reliable? it is calculated from that data, added: extrapolated intersection

- clarified the significance of the crossing point
+ highlighted
+ explain significance of crossing point

Line 10: How are the identical exponents chosen? E.g., was emed always used, or eavg, or some other value? This sentence reads as though the values were the same for all four parameters, but presumably it really means that a different exponent was used for each parameter.

Next paragraph, last sentence, suggest: the perihelion distance to be reduced to a minimum of 9.86 Rs. Reverse figures 10 and 11, since figure 11 is referenced first, or just remove the mention of Figure 11 here, which isn't necessary; the statement can be understood without looking at the figure.

+ yes, in average, see figure 5

- correct, removed remark about time lag from figure caption
+ remove remark about time lag from caption

Line 6: But the largest difference appears to be at ~1 AU, so isn't there also a problem with the dipole/quadrapole model matching the observed fields at 1 AU? 

- added an explaining sentence
+ highlighted
+ DQCS model assumes 3.1 nT at 1 au coming from CHs at +-60° latitudes (excluding field from equatorial slow wind belt)

+ need new magnetic field model?

Line 7: “Whereas”: Combine the sentences; whereas isn’t used at the beginning of a sentence. Since the peak speeds are on the declining phase of the cycle, wouldn't the peak predicted speeds occur for some intermediate sunspot number, not at SSN=200?

Paragraph 2, line 2: There is an abrupt change of topic here, and it's not immediately obvious why short term SSN predictions are relevant. There could be an introductory sentence saying that since the solar wind predictions depend on SSN, they may be refined using predictions of the SSN during the PSP mission. 

- added introductory sentences
+ highlighted
+ smooth topic change
+ why are short-term SSN predictions relevant?
+ additional argument is first perihelion

Line 5: Why should the last cycle be used rather than say a previous one? Is this based on expectations that the next cycle will also be small? 

- yes, added reference
+ highlighted
+ yes, maybe note these expectations and add reference

Line 8, suggest: the SSN during the closest perihelia, which will commence at the end of 2024 at the likely maximum phase of cycle 25, cannot be predicted at this time. Suggest moving this up to before "For the prediction of the next solar cycle..."

- adopted with addition
+ highlighted
+ can be adopted, but
+ pay attention to wording

Last line on page, suggest: because the solar wind is believed to be accelerated up to the height of the Alfvenic critical surface, which is predicted to lie on average around 17 Rs, with a range of between 15 Rs at solar minimum and 30 Rs at solar maximum.

Summary, paragraph 2: It's not really necessary to go though the procedure yet again; there is already a synopsis in the conclusions. Is it necessary to have both a conclusions and a summary section? They could be combined. 

- combined discussion and summary sections
- integrated first paragraph of summary into beginning of discussion section
- removed the second mentioning of the procedure
+ highlighted
